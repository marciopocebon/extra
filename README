Simple perl scripts that performs stylistic checking of C/C++ code.

Feel free to try them.

comment.pl
    try to locate places where comments might be needed.
    before variable declarations it might be a good idea to describe the purpose
    of the variable

define.pl
    locate defines as they should be avoided.

magic-numbers.pl
    locate magic numbers in the code. in general it is better to
    use constants than magic numbers.

tabs.pl
    warn if there are tabs in string constants. This can have surprising
    effects. it's better to use '\t'.
